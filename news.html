        Guardian Night - Come join us in the Ida B Wells Print Shop on December 4th from 6-8 pm during Guardian Night! Your 8th grader will have the chance to print their very own t-shirt and take it home for FREE!!! We will also have merchandise and student-made products for sale (t-shirts, totes, posters, and more). Also, make sure to check out our discount bin for great deals on our “Oppsie” projects. See you there!
