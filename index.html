      <p style="font-size: 46px;">Printmaking students dig deep into traditional printmaking techniques while also being encouraged to play with new experimental and innovative approaches. 
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 30px;">As a Printmaking student at IBW, you’ll produce innovative artwork in a collaborative, creative learning environment. Learn a broad range of techniques that will allow you to express your ideas with skill. Our studio is equipped with large presses for etching, monoprint, intaglio, linoleum, and lithography. We share a dark room for photo emulsion screen printing to be used for garments and posters and a vinyl printer. Students explore design and typography in sketchbooks, ink, and on computers/ or iPads. Through community events like Live T-Shirt Printing, IBW Art Show, and field trips students are hands-on collaborating with peers and learning about working in the medium today.
        In our 3rd year AP/Capstone Class, printmaking students can create an AP Art Portfolio to be submitted for possible college credit.
