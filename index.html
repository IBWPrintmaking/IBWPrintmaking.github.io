      <h1>Printmaking students dig deep into traditional printmaking techniques while also being encouraged to play with new experimental and innovative approaches. 
      </h1>
      <h3>As a Printmaking student at IBW, you’ll produce innovative work in a collaborative, creative learning environment. In coursework, you’ll learn a broad range of techniques that will allow you to express your ideas with skill. Our studio is equipped with large presses for monoprints, intaglio, linoleum and lithography, a dark room for photo emulsion screen printing for posters or garments, and a vinyl printer. Our classes encourage students to explore design in sketchbooks as well as on computers or iPads. Through community events like Live T-Shirt Printing, IBW Art Show, and field trips you’ll gain hands-on experience collaborating with your peers and learning about working in the medium today.
        In our 3rd year AP/Capstone Class, printmaking students can create an AP Art Portfolio to be submitted for possible college credit. 
        </h3>

      <h2>About Our Program</h2>
      <p>The Ida B. Wells Print Shop produces products with high-end materials funded by the students and district. Every class is given an outline for a project, and students can use their unique ideas to create whatever they want. We offer many different classes and techniques to introduce students to the wonders of the printmaking world, including burning screens, monoprints, linocuts, lithography, and etching, and they use their creative freedom to produce the clever designs offered in our shop.
